      "The nun was wildly-kissing the dead woman's hand, an ivory hand as white as the large crucifix lying across the bed. On the other side of the long body the other hand seemed still to be holding the sheet in the death grasp; and the sheet had preserved the little creases as a memory of those last movements which precede eternal immobility.\n",

They recalled to each other circumstances, words, smiles, intonations of the mother who was no longer to speak to them. They saw her again happy and calm. They remembered things which she had said, and a little motion of the hand, like beating time, which she often used when emphasizing something important.\n",

      "Out of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper, tied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these relics on the bed and chose one of them on which the word \"Father\" was written. They opened and read it.\n",

      "It was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family desk drawers, those epistles which smell of another century. The first one started: \"My dear,\" another one: \"My beautiful little girl,\" others: \"My dear child,\" or: \"My dear (laughter.\" And suddenly the nun began to read aloud, to read over to the dead woman her whole history, all her tender memories. The judge, resting his elbow on the bed, was listening with his eyes fastened on his mother. The motionless body seemed happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sister [REDACTED_PERSON_12], interrupting herself, said suddenly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These ought to be put in the grave with her; they ought to be used as a shroud and she ought to be buried in it.\" She took another package, on which no name was written. She began to read in a firm voice: \"My adored one, I love you wildly. Since yesterday I have been suffering the tortures of the damned, haunted by our memory. I feel your lips against mine, your eyes in mine, your breast against mine. I love you, I love you! You have driven me mad. My arms open, I gasp, moved by a wild desire to hold you again. My whole soul and body cries out for you, wants you. I have kept in my mouth the taste of your kisses--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge had straightened himself up. The nun stopped reading. He snatched the letter from her and looked for the signature. There was none, but only under the words, \"The man who adores you,\" the name \"[REDACTED_PERSON_13].\" Their father's name was [REDACTED_PERSON_14]. Therefore this was not from him. The son then quickly rummaged through the package of letters, took one out and read: \"I can no longer live without your caresses.\" Standing erect, severe as when sitting on the bench, he looked unmoved at the dead woman. The nun, straight as a statue, tears trembling in the corners of her eyes, was watching her brother, waiting. Then he crossed the room slowly, went to the window and stood there, gazing out into the dark night.\n",

      "\n",
      "When daylight made the candles on the table turn pale the son slowly left his armchair, and without looking again at the mother upon whom he had passed sentence, severing the tie that united her to son and daughter, he said slowly: \"Let us now retire, [REDACTED_PERSON_16].\"\n"
